# KIA Kerbal Information Agency Contract Pack
(for Kerbal Space Program and Contract Configurator)

The KIA is a very secretive secret service. Who are they working for? What do they do? Don't ask, you already know too much!
They do need your services, though. Agents need to go to places, weather photographs need to be taken. You will be paid well, if you can be quiet about it.

## Description:
This is a set of survey missions. I don't want to play without Kerbalism anymore, but the removal of surveys and incompatibility with Field Research Contracts left me few purposes for planes and rovers. I decided to create an replacement, so the KIA was born.

## Current missions:
- Drive an agent in a motorized vehicle to sites near KSC and recover them.
- Fly an agent in a plane to sites near KSC and recover them.
- Fly an agent in a plane to a place far from KSC and return.
- Fly a camera in a plane to a high recon mission far from KSC and return.
- Place a satellite with a camera in a polar orbit.
- Find the Jeeb with the McGuffin and deliver it to KSC.
- Leave a KIA applicant stranded in Orbit of Kerbin.
- Send a rover with a camera to sites on Mun.
